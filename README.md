Practice algorithms and coding challenges in Python.
# Python Projects

I use Python as a way to communicate with the computer and make use of its full capacity.  
Through Python, I try to understand how computers ‚Äúthink‚Äù and develop simple, practical solutions to everyday problems.

This repository includes my learning projects, algorithm practices, and small experiments that help me explore the logic behind programming and data.

## üß† Goals
- Improve problem-solving and logical thinking  
- Learn how to design clean and efficient code  
- Build small projects that can solve real-world tasks
